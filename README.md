Differential expression and machine learning-based gene prioritization in Huntington’s disease
# Gene Prioritization in Huntington’s Disease Using Differential Expression and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project performs a multi-level computational analysis of Huntington’s disease
mouse brain expression data. The workflow integrates differential gene expression,
machine learning–based gene prioritization, pathway enrichment, and protein-level
analysis.

## Dataset
- Source: GEO (mouse brain samples)
- Samples: Control vs Huntington’s disease
- Platform: Agilent microarray

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and normalization (limma)
2. Differential gene expression analysis
3. Exploratory analysis (PCA, heatmaps, volcano plots)
4. Machine learning (Random Forest) for gene prioritization
5. Functional enrichment analysis
6. Protein interaction and disorder analysis

## Key Results
- Identified disease-associated genes including DBP, ATG4C, and MYH7
- ML models achieved robust disease-control classification
- Functional themes included circadian regulation, autophagy, and cytoskeletal dynamics

## Tools Used
- R: limma, ggplot2, randomForest
- STRING, Enrichr, Pfam/InterPro
